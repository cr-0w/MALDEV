## `⚠️` MALWARE DEVELOPMENT

This repository was created to archive and document all of my attempts to learn and develop malware. I'm brand new to all of this; I will document my learning in the form of comments and the README files in each folder. We'll start from the absolute beginning and see how far we can get. The techniques I'd love to learn are:

- [Shellcode Injection](Shellcode%20Injection) `✅`
- DLL Injection
- DLL Proxying
- Reflective DLL Injection
- Process Hollowing
- Hook Injection
- APC Injection
- ...

> **Note**:
> *As I come across more stuff, I'll add more to the list. Moreover, as I complete the techniques above, I'll also update this list.*

## `📚` PREREQUISITES

We're going to be dealing with a lot of low-level stuff. As such, it's important to familiarize yourself with at least a low-level language like `C`, `C++`, `Assembly`, etc. I've already gone ahead and created a repository in which - like this malware development, I document my progression/learning with some low-level stuff. If you'd like to follow along with that stuff, you can find it [here](https://github.com/cr-0w/low-level).

## `🛑` DISCLAIMER

Obviously, the stuff in this repository is explicitly for educational purposes. Not that you'll be able to run this in a patched environment without getting the absolute sh*t flagged out of it. Regardless, I do not condone the use of these scripts for any malicious activities.
